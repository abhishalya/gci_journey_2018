### The start
Hi, my name is Abhinav Kaushlya. I'm 14 years old, currently studying at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Mumbai. I was introduced to programming by my cousin brother [Bhushan Khanale](https://github.com/bkhanale). He taught me some basics of C/C++ and Python, after which I was able to write some code in those languages. Later on I started practicing programming through [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) and it really helped me get a very good understanding of algorithms and the language overall.

After all this I was finally ready for the Google Code-in challenge. Obviously the lack of experience and contributing to the open-source for the first time was difficult for me. Using `git` was an essential part of the process. So, I started a bit early (before the GCI was to start) contributing to coala.

### Why coala?
I knew C/C++ and Python very well. I looked up the organizations and coala was the best choice for me. I joined their gitter channels and I found that the mentors are very helpful, not just the mentors but the entire community is helpful, talkative and I really liked that. Further, I asked some of the mentors including [Palash Nigam](https://github.com/palash25) about the community and he was very positive. So, with no time I started contributing to coala.

### Overall Experience
Overall my experience was very nice. I loved contributing to coala, and I really want to keep contributing even after the GCI. I completed about 10 (9) tasks which were `difficulty/low` tagged. But, I feel that I was able to complete most of the tasks I claimed and I learned a lot of things while completing these tasks.

I thank all of the mentors who helped me during the GCI period and also the fellow students. It was a very successful GCI for me. Next year I hope I can contribute even more ;-)
